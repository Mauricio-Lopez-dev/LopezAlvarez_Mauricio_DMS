Orlando Harley-Davidson Database Management System
Phase 1:
This version of the DMS accepts comma-delimited text files. Users will need to supply the text file to gain access to the functionalities of the software.
Once the file is located it needs to be loaded into the software to store its data. Functionalities that are included in the software are as follow:
1. Add motorcycle to the system (Load file)
2. Remove motorcycle from the system
3. Update values to an existing motorcycle
4. Display availability log of all current motorcycles stored in the software
5. Exit software

All data will be stored in a ArrayList<Motorcycle>. At each functionailty, it will prompt the user to input the corrisponding data to access the data.
The intended purpose of the software is to enable employees at Orlando Harley-Davidson to manage their data through a text file and make any nessecary changes.
In the upcoming phases, a GUI and database will be incorporated into the DMS to futher enhance the intutive experience for the user.
